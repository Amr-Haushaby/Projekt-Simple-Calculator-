# ➕ Simple Calculator (C++)

## 📘 About the Project
A simple **C++ command-line calculator** that performs basic operations such as:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

This project focuses on applying:
- Conditional statements (switch/if)
- Loops (repeat until exit)
- Functions
- Basic error handling (e.g., division by zero)

## 🛠️ Built With
- C++


## ✅ What I Practiced
- Using switch-case (or if/else) to handle multiple operations
- Reading numbers safely from the user
- Handling edge cases like division by zero
- Writing a menu-based loop (repeat until exit)
- Splitting operations into functions for clarity

## 🧩 Example

Choose Operation:  
1) +  
2) -  
3) *  
4) /  
Enter: <kbd>4</kbd>

A = <kbd>10</kbd>  
B = <kbd>2</kbd>

Result = 5
