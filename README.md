# ➕ Simple Calculator (C++)

## 📘 About the Project
A simple **C++ command-line calculator** that performs basic operations such as:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

This project focuses on applying:
- Conditional statements (switch/if)
- Loops (repeat until exit)
- Functions
- Basic error handling (e.g., division by zero)

## 🛠️ Built With
- C++
## 🧩 Example

Choose Operation:
1) +
2) -
3) *
4) /
Enter: 4

A = 10
B = 2

Result = 5

## ✅ What I Practiced
- Using switch-case (or if/else) to handle multiple operations
- Reading numbers safely from the user
- Handling edge cases like division by zero
- Writing a menu-based loop (repeat until exit)
- Splitting operations into functions for clarity
